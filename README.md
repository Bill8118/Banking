# Banking
Basic Banking App

This  a simple banking application to simulate the typical operations performed on a bank account. 
A local database was used on my local machine to update the accounts and data within their fields.
A simple GUI is also used for appearance and user interaction.
This was developed while studying for the OCA exam and to apply what i had learned as well as moving to more complicated topics.
There are some issues which i will resolve soon, mostly commenting code and replacing general exception handling with more specific exceptions.

Any feedback, positive or negative, is welcome as i am currently in third level education studying software design and wish to advance my knowledge.
